	"masteryExpIncreaseDescription": "After mastering weapon once, next time you would prestige it is would require masteryExpIncrease % more hits (from base) more. 0.05 = 5%. Example: Mastery lvl 3 on M4 requires 3600 exp. With masteryExpIncrease set to 0.05, 2nd prestige would be unlocked at 3780 (3600 * 1.05). The one after would be at 3960 (3600 * 1.1), and so on. It's linear growth, not exponential",
